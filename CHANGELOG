OpenFEC.org project CHANGELOG
-----------------------------

December 16th, 2014: release of openfec 1.4.2

- code cleanup and simplification within LDPC Gaussian Elimination decoding, fixing several memory leaks.
  Decodign speed is slightly improved, as well as the maximum memory consumption (we avoid an extra matrix
  allocation).
- fixed a bug in simple_client_server/simple_client.c causing erroneous decodings when
  USE_DECODE_WITH_NEW_SYMBOL was undefined. Fixed a small memory leaks too.
- Mac OSX 10.9 is now supported and many compilation warnings removed.
- added VERSION (here 1.4.2) and SOVERSION (here 1) to the dynamic library via cmake.
  See src/CMakeLists.txt

---

July 16th, 2014: release of openfec 1.4.1

- added a demo server/client application, which explains how to use the OpenFEC codecs. This demo application
  opens a UDP socket, the server performs FEC encoding and sends (a subset of) encoding symbols, while the
  client receives them and tries to FEC decode the object.
- major code cleanup throughout the library.
- fixed a bug in all codecs, when using of_set_available_symbols(). Thanks to Chuo-Ling who spotted the bug.

---

July 9th, 2014: release of openfec 1.4.0

- added a new -find_min_overhead parameters to eperftool, to automatically search for the minimum overhead
  for a given code configuration.
- changed the simulation tools to take advantage of the eperftool -find_min_overhead capability. This change
  enables major simulation speed improvements (the same eperftool process finds the exact overhead instead
  of launching several eperftool processes).
- fixed many bugs in the PERL simulation scripts, impproved the user interface as well (e.g. a new progression
  bar is now displayed during the simulations), and provided param_file.txt examples depending on the desired
  performance metrics and curves.
- code maintenance and cleanup for the various codecs.
- changed the web site totally, now based on the bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/). Doing so the forum
  disappeared, but a mailing list is set up instead.
NB: the two doc/howto_* PDF files have not been thoroughly updated. Yet to be done...
NB: the 1D-2D and from_file codecs have not been tested in this version. Yet to be done...

---

April 13th, 2012: release of openfec 1.3.0

- changed the LDPC-Staircase codec license for CECILL (i.e. the content of the src/lib_stable/ldpc-staircase/
  directory only). There is no change for the rest of the library that remains under a CECILL-C license.
- solved a bug in the LDPC-Staircase matrix creation algorithm when N1 is even. This bug makes the codec non
  RFC5170 compliant (!). However there was no impact with odd N1 values. This means that with an even N1, an
  application using version >= 1.3 will not interoperate with an application using version <= 1.2.
- with LDPC-Staircase, when N1 is even, the latest repair symbol is often NULL. This property is now exploited
  at the decoder to generate it automatically and pass it to the decoder. When this property applies, there is
  no need to send this repair symbol. A new OF_CTRL_LDPC_STAIRCASE_IS_LAST_SYMBOL_NULL is added to check this
  property within an application, if desired (e.g. this optimization is added to eperftool).
- solved a bug in the generate_curves.pl script when using prepared SQL statements. Thanks to the forum users :-)

---

March 3rd, 2011: release of openfec 1.2.2

- added some statistics about built/rebuilt/ignored symbols in IT and ML decoding.
- solved a bug in eperftool to use the "LDPC from file" codec
- eperftool: now, you can test codecs with callbacks for source and repair symbols creation.
- various bug corrections

---

Dec 3rd, 2010: release of openfec 1.2.1

- we solved a bug in of_[rs_|rs_2_m_]set_available_symbols(): shift wasn't done on a buffer (thanks Rakis).

---

Dec 3rd, 2010: release of openfec 1.2.0

Major release:
- we added a new optimized Reed-Solomon codec over 2^m (with m=4,8).
  Using m=4 is interesting for very small blocks (since k<n<=15), and is slightly faster than using m=8 in
  that case.
- Reed-Solomon over 2^m have both beem highly optimized and are approximatively 25 % faster than the original
  Reed-Solomon over GF(2^8) of previous release.
- Reed-Solomon over GF(2^8) still exists and has been optimized. It is 20 % faster than that previous release.
- added rs_m parameter for eperftool and for simulations (i.e there is a new entry in the params.txt file)
- Removed SSE optimization for 32bits machines. See forum for details (thanks Rakis).
- various bug corrections

---

Sept 16th, 2010: release of openfec 1.1.0

This is a major release. Main changes include:
- Factorization of the binary linear system decoding code.
  The new structure now distinguishes, in a separate directory:
  - IT (iterative) decoding code,
  - ML (maximum likelihood) decoding code,
  - Binary matrix management code.
- Various code improvements and bug corrections.
Note that the API did not change, this version being fully
backward compatible with existing applications.

----

July 2nd, 2010: first release of openfec 1.0.0 beta

This is the first release:
- It contains the following codecs:
    * LDPC-Staircase codec
    * Reed-Solomon GF(256) codec
    * 2D parity codec
    * LDPC from file codec
- It also contains an advanced simulation environment to let
  you perform easily many different kinds of tests.
