/**
 * Default maximum number of source and encoding symbols for this codec.
 * This value depends in particular on the kind of decoder used. To this
 * limit, codec implementation details might add other limits (e.g. if
 * the ESI values are stored in UINT16 instead of UINT32...).
 *
 * Hints:
 * 	If ML decoding is enabled and used, then limit yourself to a value
 * 	that is not too high, since decoding might finish with a Gaussian
 * 	elimination on the simplified system.
 * 	In situations where decoding is restricted to IT, the main limit is
 * 	the available memory. It usually means you can set very large values.
